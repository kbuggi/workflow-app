------------------- SPIKES ----------------------
Slideshow: shows photos & video in slideshow mode (external using VLC). Click fullscreen button if it doesn't do it for you.
-> original attempt using Qt was weird (the video player can't show photos, so you have to create & destroy controls)

python3 Spikes/slide_show.py Spikes/album/album.json -f Spikes/album

#TreeViewer : opens JSON/JSONC via dialog. Always opens last file on start. Also remembers recently opened files.
-> Command+ increases font size/Command- decreases.
python3 Spikes/TreeViewer.py

GitSync:  shows syncing files from a tiny github repository in a separate thread
-> clean local copy first? or during demo?

ls -la /tmp/GitSync/Config/.git
ls  /tmp/GitSync/

rm -r  /tmp/GitSync/Config 
python3 Spikes/GitSync.py
